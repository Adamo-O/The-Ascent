# The Ascent
## The Reason
The Ascent is the first video game I made, done using C# in Unity. It was made as part of the Personal Project for the IB Curriculum at my high school. 
I had a 3 month time span to make this project in Grade 11, and I have not edited it since.
The [assets](TheAscent/Assets) (the animations, sprites and audio) were created by me.

## The Goal
The objective of this project was to create an upwards 2D platformer with an overarching plot while learning C# and Unity. As the player ascends, the enemies start to act in self-defense and run away to show that they aren't evil. There are some small references in the sprites that point to the monsters being scared of the player. The reveal at the end comments on the nature of video games themselves, and how one blindly follows the rules of a game without considering their actual consequences. The name "The Ascent" comes both from the upwards 2D platformer design and a play on the phrase *Descent into madness*, since the player *ascends* into madness instead. This took influence from many games, especially Undertale by Toby Fox.

## The Game
The final version of the game is [TheAscentReleaseV3.2_Demo](TheAscent/Builds/TheAscentReleaseV3.2_Demo.exe), so head there and try it out!

Feel free to check out the [Builds](TheAscent/Builds) folder for all of the previous builds during development.
