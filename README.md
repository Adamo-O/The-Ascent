# The-Ascent
This is the first video game I made, and it was done using C# in Unity. It was made as part of the Personal Project for the IB Curriculum at my high school. 
I had a 3 month time span to make this project in Grade 11, and I have not edited it since.
The assets (both the sprites and the audio) were created by me.

The goal of this project was to create an upwards 2D platformer with a plot reveal at the end, commenting on the nature of video games themselves, and how one blindly follows the rules of a game without considering their actual consequences. This took influence from games like Undertale.
